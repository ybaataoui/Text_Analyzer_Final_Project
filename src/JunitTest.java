		String original = "OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RAVEN ***\r\n"
				+ "THIS EBOOK WAS ONE OF PROJECT GUTENBERG’S EARLY FILES. THERE IS AN IMPROVED ILLUSTRATED EDITION OF THIS TITLE WHICH MAY VIEWED AT EBOOK [ #45484 ]\r\n"
				+ "The Raven\r\n"
				+ "by Edgar Allan Poe\r\n"
				+ "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\r\n"
				+ "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\r\n"
				+ "While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\n"
				+ "As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\r\n"
				+ "“’Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\r\n"
				+ "Only this and nothing more.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\r\n"
				+ "And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\n"
				+ "Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\r\n"
				+ "From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\r\n"
				+ "For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\r\n"
				+ "Nameless here for evermore.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\n"
				+ "Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\r\n"
				+ "So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\r\n"
				+ "“’Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—\r\n"
				+ "Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;\r\n"
				+ "This it is and nothing more.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\r\n"
				+ "“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\r\n"
				+ "But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\r\n"
				+ "And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\r\n"
				+ "That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door—\r\n"
				+ "Darkness there and nothing more.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\r\n"
				+ "Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;\r\n"
				+ "But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\r\n"
				+ "And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\r\n"
				+ "This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\r\n"
				+ "Merely this and nothing more.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\r\n"
				+ "Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.\r\n"
				+ "“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\r\n"
				+ "Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore—\r\n"
				+ "Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\r\n"
				+ "’Tis the wind and nothing more.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\n"
				+ "In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.\r\n"
				+ "Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,\r\n"
				+ "But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\r\n"
				+ "Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\r\n"
				+ "Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\r\n"
				+ "By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\r\n"
				+ "“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\r\n"
				+ "Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\r\n"
				+ "Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\r\n"
				+ "Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\n"
				+ "Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\r\n"
				+ "For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\n"
				+ "Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\r\n"
				+ "Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\r\n"
				+ "With such name as “Nevermore.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\r\n"
				+ "That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour\r\n"
				+ "Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered—\r\n"
				+ "Till I scarcely more than muttered: “Other friends have flown before—\r\n"
				+ "On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\r\n"
				+ "Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n"
				+ "“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,\r\n"
				+ "Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\n"
				+ "Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\r\n"
				+ "Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n"
				+ "Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\r\n"
				+ "Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;\r\n"
				+ "Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\n"
				+ "Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\r\n"
				+ "What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\r\n"
				+ "Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\n"
				+ "To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\r\n"
				+ "This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\r\n"
				+ "On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\r\n"
				+ "But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er\r\n"
				+ "She shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\n"
				+ "Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n"
				+ "“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\r\n"
				+ "Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\r\n"
				+ "Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\r\n"
				+ "Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\r\n"
				+ "Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\n"
				+ "Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\r\n"
				+ "On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\r\n"
				+ "Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\r\n"
				+ "Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\n"
				+ "By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\r\n"
				+ "Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\n"
				+ "It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\r\n"
				+ "Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\r\n"
				+ "Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "“Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\r\n"
				+ "“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\r\n"
				+ "Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!\r\n"
				+ "Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\r\n"
				+ "Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\r\n"
				+ "Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\n"
				+ "On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\n"
				+ "And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming\r\n"
				+ "And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;\r\n"
				+ "And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n"
				+ "Shall be lifted—nevermore!\r\n"
